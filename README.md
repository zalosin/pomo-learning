## What is Pomo-Learning
Pomo-Learning is what a group of 4 Javascript fans developed in 1 and a half days at the annual Javascript hackathon `JSHacks 2019 EduTech Edition v4.0`.

The project consists of a learning platform for both students and teachers that aims to fully utilise the advantages of the pomodoro technique, but in a more personalized way.

Teachers can upload, edit and delete courses stored in digestable chunks of info.

Students can set their preferred work time duration and break time duration, and then study a course under those set times. A course will gradually enable its chunks as a user studies it.

## Pomo-Learning achievements
Pomo-Learning was one of the 4 awarded projects during the `JSHacks 2019 EduTech Edition v4.0` hackathon.
